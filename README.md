programming very well until some people including [Winter](https://github.com/Sierra007117) , [Kuayue](https://github.com/Sierra007117), [Tafara](https://github.com/TafaraLanka) helped me with the starting point.<br> and from there i then find it useful to list all the materials that might be useful to someone out their. <br><b>PLEASE NOTE:<i> it doesn't mean that the information here is only the most useful, there is lot of useful information out there.</i></b> <br>They are so many sources out there and if you think your source might help anyone, please give a link here  and help a friend who is also want to know that thing and to upgrade the world of computers.
